## Hi there, I'm Amlan Nag  ðŸ‘‹

# Machine Learning Researcher at Fiscal Realities Economists | MSc Finance Candidate - SFU Beedie 25 | AI/MLOps | Computational Finance and Quantitative Analysis  | Systematic Options Trading

# About Me:

Iâ€™m an accomplished Machine Learning Researcher with a strong foundation in Python, NLP, LLMs, and applied data analytics. My experience spans a range of technical domains including SQL, statistical modeling, database development, and full-stack web architecture. I enjoy bridging machine learning with real-world problem solvingâ€”particularly in the intersection of technology, finance, and economics.

I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computing Science from Thompson Rivers University, where I focused on analytical systems and algorithmic design. Along the way, I completed certifications in Google Data Analytics and Financial Engineering, both of which deepened my interest in financial systems and data-driven investment frameworks.

Currently, I work at Fiscal Realities Economists, applying machine learning to complex financial data, government reports, and economic planning tools. My work focuses on scalable infrastructure, predictive modeling, and developing systems that support decision-making across multi-year financial trends and investment analysis.

In Fall 2025, I will begin my Master of Science in Finance at Simon Fraser University, where I plan to focus on quantitative investment strategies and capital allocation. This next step supports my long-term interest in systematic tradingâ€”particularly in areas where market microstructure, volatility dynamics, and technology intersect.

I'm also exploring foundational finance topics through the CFA curriculum, particularly in financial analysis and portfolio theory, as part of expanding my strategic and analytical toolkit.

Outside of work, Iâ€™m involved with the Kamloops Target Sports Association and volunteer with Emergency Support Services. I value precision, structure, and long-range thinkingâ€”qualities I believe are essential in trading and data-driven finance.

Iâ€™m especially interested in building toward roles that apply machine learning and structured models to derivatives trading and strategy design. Always open to conversations around data, trading systems, and building robust analytical infrastructure in capital markets.
