#####I am an aspiring Software Developer, Specialist in Android App development, and a third-year computing science student at Thompson Rivers University. From childhood growing up alongside computers and technology, I have always been fascinated by how technology changed the world and it enhanced peopleâ€™s lives. From the fascination and eagerness of learning new technology, I choose my computing science path and have successfully completed halfway through the third year of computing science. Throughout the academic terms, I got interested in a few development environments. Now, Developing new software or App gives me potential motivation for my future career. In the future, I want to see myself as a software developer or in a technological-based industry.
