## Hi there, I'm Amlan Nag  👋

# Machine Learning Researcher at FRE | MSc Finance, SFU Beedie ’27 | MS Computer Science, Georgia Tech ’28 

# About Me:

I am a Machine Learning Researcher with expertise in Python, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLM), C++ and applied data analytics. My technical background spans SQL, statistical modeling, database development, and full-stack web architecture. My work is driven by a focus on bridging machine learning with real-world problem solving, particularly at the intersection of finance, technology, and economics.

I am currently pursuing two advanced degrees. At the Beedie School of Business, SFU, I am undertaking an MSc in Finance with a concentration in quantitative investment strategies and capital allocation. Beginning in Winter 2026, I will also pursue an MS in Computer Science at Georgia Tech (part-time), with a core focus on machine learning.

My finance master’s academic stream is in Investment Management (Specialization: Machine Learning), while my computer science master’s core research will focus on applied machine learning to trading systems, with particular emphasis on algorithmic and systematic strategies. Together, these programs form the foundation of my long-term goal: to design robust frameworks for trading and investment that integrate market microstructure, volatility dynamics, and advanced computational methods.

Professionally, I work at Fiscal Realities Economists, where I apply machine learning to complex financial data, government reports, and economic planning. My contributions include building scalable infrastructure, developing predictive models, and designing tools that support multi-year financial analysis and decision-making in public finance and investment contexts.

I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computing Science from Thompson Rivers University, where I specialized in algorithmic design and analytical systems. In addition, I have completed certifications in Google Data Analytics and Financial Engineering, both of which strengthened my expertise in financial systems and data-driven investment frameworks.
