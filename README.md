# About Me:

I am a Machine Learning Researcher with expertise in Python, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLM), C++ and applied data analytics. My technical background spans SQL, statistical modeling, database development, and full-stack web architecture. My work is driven by a focus on bridging machine learning with real-world problem solving, particularly at the intersection of finance, technology, and economics.

I am currently pursuing two advanced degrees. At the Beedie School of Business, SFU, I am undertaking an MSc in Finance with a concentration in quantitative investment strategies and capital allocation. Beginning in Winter 2026, I will also pursue an MS in Computer Science at Georgia Tech (part-time), with a core focus on machine learning.

My finance masterâ€™s academic stream is in Investment Management (Specialization: Machine Learning), while my computer science masterâ€™s core research will focus on applied machine learning to trading systems, with particular emphasis on algorithmic and systematic strategies. Together, these programs form the foundation of my long-term goal: to design robust frameworks for trading and investment that integrate market microstructure, volatility dynamics, and advanced computational methods.

Professionally, I work at Fiscal Realities Economists, where I apply machine learning to complex financial data, government reports, and economic planning. My contributions include building scalable infrastructure, developing predictive models, and designing tools that support multi-year financial analysis and decision-making in public finance and investment contexts.

I hold a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computing Science from Thompson Rivers University, where I specialized in algorithmic design and analytical systems. In addition, I have completed certifications in Google Data Analytics and Financial Engineering, both of which strengthened my expertise in financial systems and data-driven investment frameworks.
