- 🔭 Projects: 
• FNFTA Audited Financial ChatBot: Developing an AI-based agent that can extract data from the Canadian government website, including PDF texts, tables, and scanned data. This agent will use various extraction tools, such as Google Vision, to collect unstructured data. The collected data will then be processed with a framework and implemented with LLM and ChatGPT API. This will allow users to interact with the data through a trained chatbot model by simply taking a few inputs on which profile, they want to look at and will have the option to export data as per user preferences. A complete AI/ML-based solution on large-scale unprocessed databases. 
• Indigenous Database Of Economic Activities: Conducted database administration, modelling, and optimization to ensure data integrity; Developed a user-friendly application interface for database interaction; Deployed regression analyses, machine learning algorithms, and structural design; Analyzed and interpreted client data
• Revenue & Expenditure Analysis: Analyzed raw data and developed metadata for easy reference and utilization; Designed and developed calculator tools to assist in data analysis and presentation
• Applications Security Assessment and Technical Report Development: Conducted security assessments;
Developed technical reports outlining vulnerabilities and recommendations for improvement
• FMA Database and Tax Advisor Portal: Responsible for developing and managing the FMA database and tax advisor portal, including database administration, user interface design, and data analysis.
• First Nation Cannabis Jurisdiction Website: Designed and developed an information system to manage the website; Oversaw database integration, content management, and security measures
• Information Systems For Smaller Governments: Developed and implemented customized information systems for smaller governments; Designed strategies for database administration, user interface, and ongoing analytics
