## Hi there, I'm Amlan Nag  👋

# Machine Learning Researcher at FRE | MSc Finance, SFU Beedie ’27 | MS Computer Science, Georgia Tech ’28 


# About Me:

Machine Learning and Quantitative Researcher with strong foundations in statistical modeling, Bayesian inference, and time-series analysis, applied to financial markets, economic systems, and large-scale financial data. Experienced in developing predictive models, algorithmic strategies, and data-driven decision frameworks for investment and policy analysis.

Currently pursuing an MSc in Finance (SFU Beedie School of Business) with a focus on portfolio optimization, derivatives pricing, and risk management, grounding my work in asset pricing theory and applied financial modeling. In parallel, completing an MS in Computer Science (Georgia Tech) with a specialization in Machine Learning, Bayesian Statistics, Time Series Analysis, and algorithmic strategy design, providing a rigorous statistical and computational foundation for quantitative research.

Professional experience includes work at Fiscal Realities Economists, where I apply machine learning and econometric techniques to complex financial datasets, government reports, and long-term investment planning, supporting evidence-based fiscal and infrastructure decisions.

Completed professional training including the Financial Engineering and Risk Management Specialization (Columbia University) and the Google Data Analytics Certificate. Actively engaged in algorithmic trading and quantitative research through QuantConnect and GitHub projects, translating academic methods into production-oriented models and strategies.
