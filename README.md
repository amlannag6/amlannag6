# 🔭 Projects: 
- FNFTA Audited Financial ChatBot: Developing an AI-based agent that can extract data from the Canadian government website, including PDF texts, tables, and scanned data. This agent will use various extraction tools, such as Google Vision, to collect unstructured data. The collected data will then be processed with a framework and implemented with LLM and ChatGPT API. This will allow users to interact with the data through a trained chatbot model by simply taking a few inputs on which profile, they want to look at and will have the option to export data as per user preferences. A complete AI/ML-based solution on large-scale unprocessed databases.
